site with their Facebook account.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS AND MODULE HANDBOOK

ADVANCED USAGE
--------------
The post login path can be defined dynamically by setting postLoginPath
query parameter.

The module also dispatches events that other modules can subscribe to using
EventSubscriber. You can also use Rules module to react to these events. If
you want to use Rules, you need to enable Simple FB Connect - Rules Integration
sub module.
